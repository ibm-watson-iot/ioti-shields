# IBM IoT for Insurance Shields Repository
The Shields Repository complements the IoT for Insurance [Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSQNYQ_bas/iot-insurance/kc_welcome_bas.html). The shield code is provided with ready-to-use shield queries for the protected home scenario.

## Cloud Shield toolkit
The [Cloud Shield Toolkit](./shield-toolkit) contains all the operators, functions, and dependencies that are needed to develop a shield.

## Cloud Shield Template
The [Cloud Shield Template](./shield-template) shows the structure of a shield.

## Shield Examples
IoT for Insurance provides two shields: the `simple query` shield and the `complex query` shield. To learn how to add shields to IoT for Insurance, see [Creating Shields](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSQNYQ_bas/iot-insurance/iotinsurance_shield_toolkit.html) in the IBM IoT for Insurance Knowledge Center.

For details on the shield implementation and query examples, see the following resources:
