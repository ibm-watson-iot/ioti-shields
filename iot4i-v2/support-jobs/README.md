## Support Jobs

Each shield job requires two support jobs that runs at the beginning when the tenant is initialized as explained below:

1. [TransformerJob](./TransformerJob):

Listens to all sensors raw events and annotate the events with user information.

2. [ActionJob](./ActionJob):

Listens to all hazards that are generated by the shield jobs and calls the create hazard API which is in turn will invoke the external actions.
